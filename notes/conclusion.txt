1. Consider additional betting parameters:
    - Max # times allowed to bet on particular player?

2. Major improvement steps:
    - Injuries
    - Line combinations and teamwork features (aggregation of linemates, think of GNNs)
    - Scores for opposing teams defense
    - Transformer sports articles

4. Do these new features correlate with goals?

5. How close am I to DKs model?
    - "If i increase all of the odds by ~10%, do I break even?"
