1. Can I insert a new player that has played in at least 1 game into the player history table?
    - Yes. Relies on a trigger (just send the insert) AND stored procedure (called inside of the trigger) that checks whether the player ID exists in the table. If not, insert a new row.
    - Other option. Query the table into python, check in python, if there is a difference, make an update.
    - The question is, should the checks occur in MySQL or python? Most likely MySQL using trigger and procedure.
    - Update: trigger does not work. Settled for procedure for now.

2. What if I try to insert or process 2 rows of the same player into the player history table? This requires an order...
    - The trigger would need to call the procedure for each row in order
    - Current solution (procedure) should handle this by checking if there was a previous row and if there is a next row.

3. How do I convert player names to the correct player id?
    - Going to create a python script or function that takes in all possibly relevant information (name for sure, age, team, etc.)
    - Function will query player history trying to use all possible info (most specific). If it cannot find a match, recursively take info away and try again until you are left with just name. If there is exactly 1 match, use that player id. If there is more than one match, prompt the user to select the correct one? If there are 0 matches, prompt the user to find the correct player id (from hockeyreference.com) and type it in?

4. What do I do when a player is in the projected lineup (or goalie or injury) and their player id is not in the player history table?
    - The function should prompt you to find the correct one on hockeyreference.com or create your own following the same schema.
    - Should this player id should also be inserted into the player history table?

5. Is it okay to create my own player id if the player is not on hockey reference?
    - The only concern is that later in time, hockey reference could add a different player of similar name, in which case the player id would be the same. Then this is a problem, since I would wrongly associate the new player and ID with the old player ID after scraping? Maybe I could create my own player id, but this would also be difficult.

6. How do I make a correct update to player history upon insertion?
    - Stored procedure logic:
        * Check if player id exists. If not, insert new row with end date = max(end date).
        * If it exists and all the rest of the row is same, skp insertion completely.
        * If it exists and there is something different (team, age, etc.), set end date of current = date of game. Then, insert new row with new information and end date = max(end date).
    - Current procedure has complex ifelse logic (likely not optimal...)

7. How will I deal with goalscorer odds that returns names that have more than just the name? 
    - Ex: "sebastian aho (car)"
    - Need to pull that info out of name and assign that to the team variable before you send into the match function for player ids.

8. How will I deal with players that have duplicate primary key in lineup (or injury?) tables?
    - Ex: alex ovechkin pp1 and pp2
    - Thought about converting unit num column to categorical and using "both", but this wont work in situations where the position diffs on each pp unit...
    - Might need to change the table columns???

9. What happens if age changes in between long stretches where a player doesnt play game... how would I know age at any particular point in time?
    - Instead of age, scrape their DOB from hockey reference using player id. Store this instead of age.
