First atttempt (regression)
- Learning plateaus quick
- All bets negative EV (predicts very low ammount of goals scored --> poisson probabilities very low)
- Searching best odds parameters is not stable. Validation performance doesn't imply testing performance at all.

Second attempt (binary classification)
- Learning plateaus quick
- Predicts probability directly (removes Poisson constraint)
- Some bets positive EV, but still not really any performance improvement
- (I dont think probabilities within each player vary very much)

Concerns
- Current features are not good enough
- Don't have very much data (only like 60,000 training rows) Is this really enough for deep learning?
- Don't have a baseline for binary classification...

Next steps
- Does binary classifcation make more sense than the regression?
- What do I do for a baseline for binary classifcation?
- Should I be looking into what is happening with predictions, expected values, which bets are winning and losing, etc..
- Should I be looking into model specific feature importance (permutation approach for NN). In other words, how important is it right now to be examining feature importance. Should I be doing this, or just going back to add in more features?
- Should I go back and get the last season of data? Don't want to go too far back, but at the same time, need more.


Deal with per60 when data has null values 
add in new features
further investigate model predictions in terms of probability of scoring goal and EV of the bet. Does this match what you found in the odds eda?
