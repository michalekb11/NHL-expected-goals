Only scheduled around 2 weeks left of work then turning to blog and presentation.

What should I focus on next:

1. Why don't better model predictions translate to better profit?
    - How is the model deciding on best betting parameters? Is the model identifying best betting parameters because there was 1 player that went on a hot streak?
    - If I only use EV constraints and nothing else, I likely am not overfitting betting parameters. Does this mean that the predicted EV's are not accurate (in other words, the predictions themselves are not accurate)?
        ... What if its just saying to bet on the same player every game (all 19 bets were for 1 player) because the predictions and the odds don't vary very much, so the EV is always positive.


Distribution of bets chosen is not statistically different from the distribution not chosen (not enough power). Analogous to rare event problem.

2. Try other models
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost

3. Try creating other features/model structures?
