It’s been a busy off-season for the Red Wings trying to figure things out. While they were able to pick up Alex DeBrincat in a blockbuster trade, he will have to bring some offense of his own. For the Detroit Red Wings, the team has to be hoping that they can find some offense in other areas. Some of that will come from the returning players; one of them is veteran David Perron, who needs to find the back of the net again in 2023-24. Before the 2022-23 season, Perron was brought in during free agency and has become a fan-favorite while also being more than serviceable for the Red Wings. He’s performed well offensively and has been worth the money.\")"
