This is an issue because when we left join the goalie information to the skater information, we will be duplicating a lot of rows in the skater data frame (ex: there will be 2 rows in the goalie data frame that have the same date and team information as 1 row in the skater data. \n",

For new predictions (games that have yet to occur), the goalie will be whichever goalie is slated to start for that game. For old observations and situations described above, we have to choose how to reduce the number of goalies to only 1 per game.\n",

    "The main thing we want to capture when training the model is which goalie a skater may have an advantage over. We want to know which goalies a particular skater is going to score a lot of goals against. Because of this, these special training observations should be assigned a goalie using the following criteria:\n",
    "1. Choose the goalie that gave up the most goals during the game. This maximizes the probability that any skater on the opposing team scored their respective goal against this goalie.\n",

We may be able to assume that the majority of a skaters interactions with a goalie were with the goalie that spent the most TOI. Hopefully, this is more reflective of why they were or were not able to score a goal in the game.\n",
